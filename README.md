# folder-colorizer
Changes the color of folder icons on Windows to help me sort my files

To use, place the `colorIcons.icl` (from the Icons folder in the repository) at the path `C:\colorIcons.icl`.  
You can also edit line 115 of MainWindow.xaml.cs to use a different path.  Build the project in Visual Studio and drag a folder into one
of the colored blocks to recolor it.
